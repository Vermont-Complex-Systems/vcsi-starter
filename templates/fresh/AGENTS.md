# AGENTS.md

A scrollytelling site built on `@the-vcsi/scrolly-kit` (SvelteKit + Svelte 5). The **fresh** template is dynamic / server-rendered (`adapter-node`).

You have access to two MCP servers (configured by `@the-vcsi/scrolly-skills`):

### scrolly-kit MCP (`@the-vcsi/scrolly-mcp`)

Docs for scrolly-kit components, layouts, and story patterns. Call `list-sections` FIRST to discover sections, then `get-documentation` to fetch every section relevant to the task.

### Svelte MCP

Svelte 5 runes and SvelteKit docs. Run `svelte-autofixer` on any Svelte code you write, repeatedly, until it reports no issues.

## Conventions

- Stories live in `src/lib/stories/{slug}/` (`components/Index.svelte` + `data/copy.json`). Run `npm run new-story <slug>` to scaffold one — never hand-create the folders.
- A story's data (CSV/JSON the user provides) goes in that story's own `data/` folder (`src/lib/stories/{slug}/data/`), next to `copy.json` — not `~/data` or a repo-root `data/`.
- Run `npm run check` before considering work done.
- Server-rendered: remote functions in `$lib/story.remote.ts` use `query()`. `export const ssr = false` is safe here if a route needs it.
